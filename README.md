## üìä Project Overview

In this project, we employed a stack-based ensemble learning technique to analyze and predict crime trends. The dataset was meticulously pre-processed, and multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model. The stacked ensemble model demonstrated its superiority by improving prediction accuracy over individual models.

### Models Implemented:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **SVM Classifier**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Stacked-Based Ensemble Model** (Combining the 3 of the above models)

### Why Stack-Based Ensemble Learning?

The stack-based ensemble learning model outperformed the individual models by leveraging their unique strengths. By stacking these models, we were able to reduce bias and variance, leading to more robust and reliable predictions. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios where different models excel at different aspects of the prediction task.
